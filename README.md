Motherless PHP Web Bot Library
==============================

This library makes it easy for PHP developers to create Motherless bots. Motherless bots respond to triggers written in shouts, comments, board posts, and group forum posts.


Installation
------------
Checkout the git repository, or simply copy the WebBot.php class to your own project source directory.


Usage
-----
The index.php script gives an example of creating a simple Motherless bot, which responds to the +quote trigger with a random quote.


Registering Your Bot
--------------------
Once you create your own bot, you need to register it with Motherless to have it called
when triggered. More details coming soon.
